# About

RepAIr Skin is an iOS app designed to address skin-related issues and enhance users' self-confidence and self-image. Leveraging an object detection model trained specifically on facial features, the app identifies and analyzes blemishes, including their count and location on the face. Users receive personalized product recommendations after completing a brief survey about their skin type and scanning their face. Built with Swift and powered by a database managed by SwiftData, RepAIr Skin also features a chatbot powered by OpenAI, offering real-time answers to users' skincare questions. Developed entirely on Xcode for iOS devices, our app aims to support users in their skincare journey and promote their overall well-being.
